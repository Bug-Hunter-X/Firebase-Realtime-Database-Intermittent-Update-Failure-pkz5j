The solution involved implementing a more robust data update mechanism using transactions. Instead of simply incrementing the counter, we use a transaction to atomically read the current value, increment it, and write back the new value. This prevents conflicts and ensures data consistency even in situations where multiple clients update the data concurrently.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js

firebase.database().ref('counter').transaction(function(currentData) {
  if (currentData === null) {
    return 1; // Initialize if not present
  } else {
    return currentData + 1;
  }
});
```

By utilizing transactions, the chances of encountering data inconsistency are significantly reduced.
